Presto Companion
================

Helps you to create PrestaShop modules like professional developers!

This package is about providing you some scripts to helps you setup your tests
and your CI for PrestaShop 1.7+ modules.

This assumes minimal requirements:

* you're able to install and use Git
* you're able to install and use Composer
* you're able to create Travis account and setup a build

> If you don't have these requirements, you should start to learn Git & Composer "before" thinking about the creation of PrestaShop 1.7+ modules.

## How to use it?

Look at the test suite and at `dist` folder for use of these scripts.

## Contributions?

Yes, I'd like to have distribution files for Gitlab CI and AppVeyor CI if possible. Anyway, you're welcome here if you're here to contribute.

## Questions/Issues?

Well... no thanks! Provide pull requests or fork!
